#
#   Problem: create a program that the user can specify a file and have
#           and created a weighted average of various grades
#
#   input: <file> for the file name
#   output: <average> the weighted average for the student
#
#   Certification of Authenticity:
#   I certify that this homework is entirely my own work.
